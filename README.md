## Abstract
In our study, we analyze decision-making behaviors in humans and mice, uncovering a common cognitive strategy involving history-dependent evidence accumulation. The study reveals that individual differences in choice repetition are influenced by a history-dependent bias in the rate of evidence accumulation, rather than its starting point, emphasizing the importance of evidence integration across multiple temporal scales. This discovery is crucial for understanding decision-making processes across mammalian species and sets the foundation for future research into the neural dynamics of these phenomena.
